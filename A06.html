            <h2>Our Mission</h2>
            <p>San Joaquin Valley Town Hall is a non-profit organization that is run by an all-volunteer board of directors. Our mission is
                to bring nationally and internationally renowned, thought-provoking speakers who inform, educate, and entertain our
                audience! As one or our members told us:</p>
            <blockquote>"Each year I give a ticket package to each of our family members. I think of it as the gift of knowledge...and
                that is priceless."</blockquote>
